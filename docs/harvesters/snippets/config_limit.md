**`limit`** [_optional_]

The `limit` parameter is used to control the number of entities returned in a single response.

When we're working with remote APIs, we utilize the pagination technique to limit the number of entities returned in a single response. This is done to avoid performance issues and to ensure that the response is manageable.

**Type**: `int`

**Default**: `50`
