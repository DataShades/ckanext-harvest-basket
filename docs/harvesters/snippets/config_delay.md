**`delay`** [_optional_]

The `delay` parameter is used to control the time between requests to the remote API.

When we're working with remote APIs, we need to be mindful of the rate limits imposed by the API provider. The `delay` parameter allows us to control the time between requests to the remote API. This is done to avoid exceeding the rate limits and to ensure that the requests are spaced out.

**Type**: `int`

**Default**: `0`
