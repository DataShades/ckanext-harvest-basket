A list of configuration settings for the harvest basket extension:

---

**`ckanext.harvest_basket.allow_anonymous`** [_optional_]

By default, `ckanext-harvest` does not restrict access to the harvester pages. This means that anyone can access the harvester pages, even if they are not logged in.

You can disallow accessing harvester pages for anonymous users.

**Default**: `True`
